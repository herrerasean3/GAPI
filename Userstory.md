# Gundam API Userstory

## Upon accessing GAPI:

The user is brought to a landing page which has a header, an 'Access' bar with a placeholder of 'people/1' within it, and an example of the API's data, using a readonly text field containing content from the api.

## Basic Access:

On the landing page and all valid API pages, the 'access' bar acts as a way for a user to type in one of the master table names and optionally an ID. Functionally, the access bar is much like accessing API URLs.

## Searching:

Advanced users may perform more detailed searches by detailing the master table they wish to target, along with whatever parameters they wish to filter by, using Query Strings in the URL. As a non-MVP feature, a proper frontend search form can be created.
