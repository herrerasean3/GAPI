# JOINS

Working in small groups of 2-3, redefine\recreate the exercise you did on  Monday's where your group investigated the SWAPI JSON data and created a main table and at least 2 or more supporting tables.  

The deliverables for this lab are the following:

- Create a seed file that creates a star_wars_db, the 2 or more supporting tables (which should include a REFERNCE to the main table) and at least 5 entries in each table.
- The seed file can be divided into two separate files: one that creates the datbase and then imports one or more supporting seed files. 
- Create a JOIN query for each of the following JOIN types:
    + Cross
    + Inner
    + OUTTER
    + LEFT OUTTER
- A readme file that walks the user through importing the table, a readme table that represents the actual tables with at least one or more rows of data and the code used to perform the JOINs. 

Time permitting the instructor will ask at least 2-3 groups to demo their readme tables 

### BONUS: As a group see if you can score 100% on the following [JOIN quiz](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/JOIN_Quiz)
