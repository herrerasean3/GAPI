# GAPI

## What the heck is GAPI?

GAPI, or Gundam API, is an API devoted to the Gundam franchise with full range of CRUD support, built primarily using SQL.

When the API is accessed, it generates a view based on user search terms and serves the resulting view up as accessible content.

Supporing logins, valid users may create, edit, or delete entries in the actual database tables.

## Why GAPI?

GAPI started as me getting sidetracked a bit in a lab assignment, actually. Rather than make a basic Star Wars database, I decided I'd build one for something I was more passionate about. Following that lab assignment, I continued to work on the database on the side, continually building upon its functionality and depth of data. GAPI is a passion project, from one Real Robot fan to another.
